I, ERIK IVAN RIVERA, standing within the Chamber of Silence,
do hereby declare my Will to tread the Path of Thelema.
I bind myself to the Law: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
I undertake the Student’s Task with discipline and devotion,
seeking the Light of the A∴A∴, and the knowledge of my True Will.
Love is the law, love under will.
